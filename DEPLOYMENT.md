## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- ✅ `Procfile` created
- ✅ `runtime.txt` created
- ✅ `requirements.txt` up to date
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured (excludes .env, venv/, etc.)
- ✅ All tests passing (93/93)
- ✅ Code committed to Git

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables (Optional)

If deploying to production, you may want to set:

```bash
DEBUG=False
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
MAX_TEXT_LENGTH=5000
```

**Note:** The app works fine with defaults, these are optional.

---

## ⚡ What Happens During Deployment

1. **Platform detects Python** from `runtime.txt`
2. **Installs dependencies** from `requirements.txt`
3. **Downloads DistilBERT model** (~268MB, first startup only)
4. **Starts server** using `Procfile` command
5. **Assigns public URL**

**First Deployment:** 3-5 minutes (model download)  
**Subsequent Deploys:** 1-2 minutes (cached)

---

## 🧪 Testing Deployed API

Once deployed, test with:

```bash
# Replace with your actual URL
$url = "https://your-app.railway.app"

# Health check
curl "$url/health"

# Full analysis
$body = @{
    text = "Yeh movie bahut accha hai! I loved it!"
} | ConvertTo-Json

curl -X POST "$url/api/v1/analyze" `
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
     -Body $body
```

Or visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/docs` for Swagger UI

## 💰 Cost Estimates

| Platform | Free Tier | Paid (if needed) |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Railway** | $5 credit/month | $0.000463/GB-hour |
| **Render** | 750 hours/month | $7/month |
| **Fly.io** | 3 shared-cpu VMs | $1.94/month per VM |
| **Heroku** | Discontinued free tier | $5-7/month |

**Recommendation:** Start with Railway's free tier ($5 credit)

---

## 🔍 Monitoring After Deployment

**Check logs:**

**Railway:**
```bash
railway logs
```

**Render:**
- View in dashboard under "Logs" tab

**Fly.io:**
```bash
fly logs
```

**Heroku:**
```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

## 🐛 Common Deployment Issues

### Issue 1: Model Download Timeout
**Solution:** Some platforms have build timeouts. The 268MB model should download fine, but if it times out, consider using a smaller model or pre-downloading.

### Issue 2: Memory Limit
**Solution:** App needs ~1.5GB RAM. Most free tiers provide 512MB-1GB. Upgrade to paid tier if needed.

### Issue 3: Cold Starts
**Solution:** Free tiers sleep after inactivity. First request after sleep takes ~60 seconds (model reload). Paid tiers keep apps running.

---

## ✅ Deployment Success Indicators

When deployment succeeds, you should see:

1. ✅ Build logs show successful pip install
2. ✅ Model download completes (268MB)
3. ✅ Server starts with "Uvicorn running on..."
4. ✅ Health check returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
5. ✅ `/docs` shows Swagger UI
6. ✅ API responds to test requests

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test all endpoints** via `/docs`
2. **Share API URL** with your team
3. **Monitor usage** in platform dashboard
4. **Set up custom domain** (optional)
5. **Enable HTTPS** (automatic on all platforms)
6. **Add monitoring** (optional: Sentry, LogRocket)
